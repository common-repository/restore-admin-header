Add the link to your site back to the top of your WordPress admin!

== Description ==

WordPress v3.3 removed the header from the admin interface, merging it with the admin bar.

This meant that the link to your site's front page was taken away and you now have to go through drop down menus to get to the link.

Instead, this plugin puts that link back onto your admin interface.

== Installation ==

Simple install in /wp-content/plugins and activate like any other!

* First version - nothing changed of course!
